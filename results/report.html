<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="executive-summary">Executive summary</h2>
<p>We took the data from the PSTAT 197A capstone survey to explore any relationships or patterns that could help us better understand the students taking the capstone. Using statistical methods and R, we analyzed three research questions surrounding students’ project preferences, coding proficiency/comfortability, and research experience.</p>
<p>For the first analysis we examined if there were any factors that made students more likely to be indifferent towards/prefer a research capstone project. By examining p-values derived from chi-squared tests/ Fisher’s exact type between our target variable (<code>projtype</code>) and each other variable, we found two plausible candidates, <code>updv.num</code> and <code>lang</code>. We wanted to know which specific responses were correlated to an indifference/preference for research, and ultimately found that the factor most contributing to a student’s preference/indifference for reseatch was a student’s who preference for R.</p>
<p>For the second, we examined whether taking CMPSC 9 or CMPSC 16 was related to students’ self rated coding proficiency and comfortability. We found no statistical relationship between courses taken and either proficiency or comfortability. The correlation coefficients were near zero, and all p-values exceeded .05, suggesting no meaningful relationship between the class taken or coding ability.</p>
<p>For the third question, we found that students who participated in research and those who did not showed similar average numbers of domains of interest, with no statistically significant difference between their means (p = 0.6418). However, the research group exhibited greater variability and a more right-skewed, bell-shaped distribution with a peak at 3, while the non-research group exhibited a more uniform distribution.</p>

<section id="data-description" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="data-description">Data description</h2>
<p>The dataset was obtained from a survey that all 2025 Fall Quarter PSTAT 197A students completed. Students were informed that this data would be used by the class for analysis and had the option to opt out of being in the dataset. Sixty students were surveyed, and fifty-two consented to have their data examined in the Module 0 project. Personal identifying information that were collected but not included in the dataset (removed to protect privacy) were time of submission, perm number, major(s), minor(s), standing, gender, race, goals for the project, and comments on research experience.</p>
<p>For each student, their self-rated programming, math, and statistics proficiency and comfort were recorded.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Students had the option to rate their proficiency on a scale of beginner, intermediate, or advanced.</p></li>
<li><p>Students had the option to rate their comfort from 1 to 5 (1 being the least comfortable).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, the dataset includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Student’s number of upper-division courses taken (which can be either 0–2, 3–5, 6–8, or 9+).</p></li>
<li><p>Whether they have a special domain of interest (yes, no, or unsure).</p></li>
<li><p>Whether they have a preference for working on an industry project, a lab project, or no preference.</p></li>
<li><p>Whether they have taken the following courses (1 for yes, 0 for no):</p>
<ul>
<li><p>PSTAT: 100, 115, 120, 122, 126, 127, 131, 134, 160, 174</p></li>
<li><p>CS: 5, 9, 16, 130</p></li>
<li><p>LING: 104, 110, 111</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Whether they have done research (true or false).</p></li>
<li><p>Preferred coding language: Python, R, or No preference.</p></li>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="questions-of-interest">Questions of interest</h2>
<p>We sought to understand the relationship between coursework and a student’s proficiency/curiosity. Our analysis addressed three questions:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Is there a relationship between any variable and a student’s neutrality or preference for a research project?</li>
<li>Does taking CMPSC 9 (<strong>Intermediate Python Programming</strong>) or CMPSC 16 (<strong>Problem Solving with Computers I</strong>) have any relation to self rated proficiency level in coding?</li>
<li>Do people who have done research have more or less domains of interest compared to people who have not done research?</li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="findings" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="findings">Findings</h2>
<p>Question 1: Is there a relationship between a student’s neutrality or preference for a research project?</p>
<p>To answer this question, we merged the two separate datasets of background and interest attributes. Our target variable was <code>projtype</code>, from the background dataset. We re encoded it into a binary response of 0 indicating an industry preference, and 1, indicating no preference or a preference for research.</p>
<p>Since we were dealing with categorical variables, we created contingency table for each variable that compares its responses with the target variable. Then, a Chi-squared test is ran to check for significant association. For counts less than five, a Fisher’s exact test was used.</p>
<p>Finally, we printed the subset of variables that had a p-value of &lt; 0.05 (which indicated a significant association with a preference for research vs industry). This is the table we acquired:</p>
<p><img src="images/q1pval.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>The <code>type</code> variable from the interest dataset was not available in the metadata, with the target variable projtype being the only seemingly related one. type originated from the interest dataset, and had responses of “both, ind and lab”. These seemingly correspond to the responses for <code>projtype</code>, so we believed it was fair to assume that <code>type</code> is a duplicate variable of <code>projtype</code>. Thus, we proceeded by analyzing the variables <code>updv.num</code> and <code>lang</code>.</p>
<p>The more significant of the two was <code>updv.num</code> (which corresponds to the amount of upper division PSTAT classes students have taken). We created another frequency table in order to see which responses to the number of upper division classes taken question corresponded to a preference/indifference towards research.</p>
<p><img src="images/updivfreq.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p><img src="images/PNG%20image.png" class="img-fluid" width="488"></p>
<p>These results must also be considered with the frequency of each response for <code>updv.num</code>, displayed in the table below:</p>
<p><img src="images/numupdiv.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Due to largely varying sample sizes above, It’s difficult to draw conclusions by examining the frequency table/bar chart for classes taken and research preference.</p>
<p>The second most significant variable was <code>lang</code> (corresponding to which programming language the student prefers). We created another frequency table in order to see which responses to the preffered languages question corresponded to a preference for research or not.</p>
<p>Language Response Frequency Table:</p>
<p><img src="images/langfreq.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p><code>lang</code> had slightly more uniform sample sizes, allowing us to ultimately conclude that students who prefer R prefer/are indifferent to research projects.</p>
<p>Question 2: Does taking CMPSC 9 (<strong>Intermediate Python Programming</strong>) or CMPSC 16 (<strong>Problem Solving with Computers I</strong>) have any relation to self rated proficiency or comfort ability level in coding?</p>
<p>To analyze this question, we divided it into different parts. We compared each course (CMPSC 16 and CMPSC 9) individually in relation to self rated programming proficiency in comfort levels. This resulted in the creation of 4 distinct datasets, each including a binary variable displaying whether the class was taken (0=not taken, 1=taken) and another including the self rated proficency or comfort level. Proficiency was originally on a character scale of beginning, intermediate, and advanced, which we then converted to the numeric scale of 1, 2, and 3. Comfort level was a scale of 1 to 5, 1 being the least comfortable and 5 being the most.</p>
<p>For each dataset we found the correlation between the course taken and proficiency/comfort. We also performed a chi-squared test, as we were finding the relationship between categorical variables. The results are summarized below below:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Dataset 1: CMPSC 16, prog.prof</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Correlation coefficient: .19</p></li>
<li><p>P-Value of Chi-Squared Test: .34</p></li>
<li><p><img src="report_files/figure-html/progprofcs16.png" class="img-fluid"></p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Dataset 2: CMPSC 9, prog.prof</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Correlation coefficient: .05</p></li>
<li><p>P-Value of Chi-Squared Test: .69</p></li>
<li><p><img src="report_files/figure-html/progprofcs9.png" class="img-fluid"></p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Dataset 3: CMPSC 16, prog.comf</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Correlation coefficient: 0.37</p></li>
<li><p>P-Value of Chi-Squared Test: .0.99</p></li>
<li><p><img src="report_files/figure-html/cs16-comfplot.png" class="img-fluid"></p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Dataset 4: CMPSC 9, prog.comf</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Correlation coefficient: -0.17</p></li>
<li><p>P-Value of Chi-Squared Test: .99</p></li>
<li><p><img src="report_files/figure-html/cs9-comfplot.png" class="img-fluid"></p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>From our tests, we found no significant relationship between self rated programming proficiency and whether each course was taken or not. Both classes have very weak positive correlations with proficiency, and their p-values &gt; .05 indicated that the relationship is not significant. Additionally, both courses show weak correlations with self-rated programming comfort; CMPSC 16 exhibits a small positive relationship, while CMPSC 9 shows a slight negative relationship. However, all p-values exceed 0.05, indicating that none of these associations are statistically significant. In summary, there is no meaningful evidence that taking CMPSC 9 or CMPSC 16 has a significant impact on students’ self-rated programming proficiency or comfort level.</p>
<p>Question 3: Do people who have done research have more or less domains of interest compared to people who have not done research?</p>
<p>In order to investigate this question, we first started by combining the background and interests datasets and filtering for students that marked ‘Yes’ and ‘No’ for whether they had research experience. After, we calculated summary statistics on these two groups, particularly, the mean, variance, and n, of number of domains of interest, and got the following:</p>
<div class="cell" data-hash="report_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-2_84f9d8fc09a1ec1af97c06776d6b434f">
<div class="cell-output-display">

<td style="text-align: right;">1.617647</td>
<td style="text-align: right;">17</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
</div>
<p>To further get a better idea of the two distributions, we plotted bar charts of the domains of interest:</p>
<div class="cell" data-hash="report_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-3_8674a9eeecf1ff5f164acefb44566370">

<div class="cell-output-display">
<p><img src="report_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-2.png" class="img-fluid" width="672"></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>We found that the mean number of domains of interest between students who have participated in research versus those who have not are similar in value, with the variance of the research group being higher. This higher variance could stem from the fact that there are more individuals who had done research (around double). Additionally, looking at the two distributions, those who had done research had more of a bell shaped curve, skewed to the right, with a peak at 3 domains of interest. On the other hand, those who had not done research had almost a ‘uniform’ distribution, with equal number of students choosing 2, 3, 4, and 5 domains of interest.</p>
<p>Lastly, we conducted a t-test to see if there was a statistically significant difference between the two means of domains of interest.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>We got a p-value of 0.6418, which is greater than 0.05 (alpha level), thus we conclude there is no significant difference between the two means.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In conclusion, we found that students who have participated in research have the same number of domains of interest compared to those who have not participated in research.</p>
