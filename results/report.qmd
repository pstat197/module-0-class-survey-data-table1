## Executive summary

Write a one-paragraph abstract summarizing what you did and your findings. It need not be comprehensive; try to highlight the most important or interesting outcomes.

## Data description

The dataset was obtained from a survey that all 2025 Fall Quarter PSTAT 197A students completed. Personal identifying information was removed to ensure anonymity. Students were asked about classes they took, whether they have done research, what year they were, what preference for projects they have, etc. Students were informed that this data would be used by the class, and had the option to opt out of being in the dataset.

## Questions of interest

We sought to understand the relationship between coursework and a student's proficiency/curiosity. Our analysis addressed three questions:

1.  Does there exists a relationship between student's preference for non-industry projects and any other variables.
2.  Does taking CMPSC 9 (**Intermediate Python Programming**) versus CMPSC 16 (**Problem Solving with Computers I**) has any relation to self rated proficiency level in coding?
3.  Do people who have done research have more or less domains of interest compared to people who have not done research?

## Findings

Summarize your results. Don't try to explain every step you took; focus instead on providing the main data analytic outputs -- tables and figures -- and explaining clearly what they show. Clarify any important decisions you made in obtaining them. You can display codes if you like but it is not necessary.
