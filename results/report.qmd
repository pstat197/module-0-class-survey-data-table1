## Executive summary

We took the data from the PSTAT 197A capstone survey and sought to find if there were any correlations and connections in the data that may help us better understand the students taking the capstone. We used R to do our data analysis and came up with guiding questions that directed our research. Our findings are summarized in this document.

## Data description

The dataset was obtained from a survey that all 2025 Fall Quarter PSTAT 197A students completed. Personal identifying information was removed to ensure anonymity. Students were asked about classes they took, whether they have done research, what year they were, what preference for projects they have, etc. Students were informed that this data would be used by the class, and had the option to opt out of being in the dataset.

## Questions of interest

We sought to understand the relationship between coursework and a student's proficiency/curiosity. Our analysis addressed three questions:

1.  Is there a relationship between any variable and a student's neutrality or preference for a research project?
2.  Does taking CMPSC 9 (**Intermediate Python Programming**) or CMPSC 16 (**Problem Solving with Computers I**) have any relation to self rated proficiency level in coding?
3.  Do people who have done research have more or less domains of interest compared to people who have not done research?

## Findings

Summarize your results. Don't try to explain every step you took; focus instead on providing the main data analytic outputs -- tables and figures -- and explaining clearly what they show. Clarify any important decisions you made in obtaining them. You can display codes if you like but it is not necessary.

Question 1: Is there a relationship between a student's neutrality or preference for a research project?

To answer this question, we merged the two separate datasets of background and interest attributes. Our target variable was `projtype`, from the background dataset. We re encoded it into a binary response of 0 indicating an industry preference, and 1, indicating no preference or a preference for research.

Since we were dealing with categorical variables, we created contingency table for each variable that compares its responses with the target variable. Then, a Chi-squared test is ran to check for significant association. For counts less than five, a Fisher's exact test was used.

Finally, we printed the subset of variables that had a p-value of \< 0.05 (which indicated a significant association with a preference for research vs industry). This is the table we acquired:

The `type` variable from the interest dataset was not available in the metadata, with the target variable projtype being the only seemingly related one. type originated from the interest dataset, and had responses of "both, ind and lab". These seemingly correspond to the responses for `projtype`, so we believed it was fair to assume that `type` is a duplicate variable of `projtype`. Thus, we proceeded by analyzing the variables `updv.num` and `lang`.

The more significant of the two was `updv.num` (which corresponds to the amount of upper division PSTAT classes students have taken). We created another frequency table in order to see which responses to the number of upper division classes taken question corresponded to a preference/indifference towards research.

These results must also be considered with the frequency of each response for `updv.num`, displayed in the table below:

Due to largely varying sample sizes above, It's difficult to draw conclusions by examining the frequency table/bar chart for classes taken and research preference.

The second most significant variable was `lang` (corresponding to which programming language the student prefers). We created another frequency table in order to see which responses to the preffered languages question corresponded to a preference for research or not.

`lang` had slightly more uniform sample sizes, allowing us to ultimately conclude that students who prefer R prefer/are indifferent to research projects.

Question 2: Does taking CMPSC 9 (**Intermediate Python Programming**) or CMPSC 16 (**Problem Solving with Computers I**) have any relation to self rated proficiency or comfort ability level in coding?

To analyze this question, we divided it into different parts. We compared each course (CMPSC 16 and CMPSC 9) individually in relation to self rated programming proficiency in comfort levels. This resulted in the creation of 4 distinct datasets, each including a binary variable displaying whether the class was taken (0=not taken, 1=taken) and another including the self rated proficency or comfort level. Proficiency was originally on a character scale of beginning, intermediate, and advanced, which we then converted to the numeric scale of 1, 2, and 3. Comfort level was a scale of 1 to 5, 1 being the least comfortable and 5 being the most.

For each dataset we found the correlation between the course taken and proficiency/comfort. We also performed a chi-squared test, as we were finding the relationship between categorical variables. The results are summarized below below:

-   Dataset 1: CMPSC 16, prog.prof

    -   Correlation coefficient: .19

    -   P-Value of Chi-Squared Test: .34

    -   ![]()![](report_files/figure-html/progprofcs16.png)![]()

-   Dataset 2: CMPSC 9, prog.prof

    -   Correlation coefficient: .05

    -   P-Value of Chi-Squared Test: .69

    -   ![](report_files/figure-html/progprofcs9.png)

-   Dataset 3: CMPSC 16, prog.comf

-   Dataset 4: CMPSC 9, prog.comf

From our tests, we found no significant relationship between self rated programming proficiency and whether each course was taken or not. Both classes have very weak positive correlations with proficiency, and their p-values \> .05 indicated that the relationship is not significant.
